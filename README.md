# LegionAGI: Bringing Sentient Intelligence to AI

LegionAGI is an advanced framework that blends ideas from quantum physics, neuroscience, and computer science to create an AI that learns, adapts, and works like a team of experts. In simple terms, itâ€™s a next-generation system designed to evolve its own intelligenceâ€”getting smarter and more creative over time.

---

## What Is LegionAGI?

LegionAGI aims to overcome traditional AI limits by:

- **Mimicking Human Thought**: Inspired by the brainâ€™s ability to consider multiple possibilities and quantum systemsâ€™ probabilistic nature, it evaluates many outcomes simultaneously.
- **Working as a Team**: It uses specialized "agents" (mini-experts) that collaborate to solve complex problems, much like a team of humans brainstorming together.
- **Self-Improving Over Time**: The system learns from its experiences, refining its strategies and improving its performance over time.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Quantum-Inspired Memory
- **Concept**: Stores information as a "probability cloud" of possibilities, enabling simultaneous exploration of multiple solutions.
- **Example**: In medical diagnosis, LegionAGI evaluates many potential conditions at once before narrowing down to the most likely one.

### 2. Multi-Agent Collaboration
- **Agents as Specialists**: 
  - **Analytical agents** crunch numbers and process data.
  - **Creative agents** brainstorm innovative ideas.
  - **Strategic agents** plan and refine decisions.
- **Collaboration**: Agents share insights in a shared "workspace," combining their expertise to form comprehensive solutions.

### 3. Self-Improving Algorithms
- **Learning from Experience**: The system adjusts its methods based on past successes and failures, much like humans refining skills through practice.
- **Continuous Evolution**: Every problem solved improves LegionAGIâ€™s ability to tackle future challenges more effectively.

---

## The Science Behind It

### Key Innovations:
- **Quantum Memory Simulation**: Uses probabilistic principles (inspired by quantum mechanics) to explore multiple outcomes simultaneously.
- **Team-Based Reasoning Frameworks**:
  - **PAST (Probabilistic Analysis of State Transitions)**: Predicts future outcomes by analyzing probabilistic pathways.
  - **RAFT (Reasoning and Action Framework for Thought)**: Enables real-time collaboration between agents.
  - **EAT (Emergent Architecture for Thought)**: Allows the system to evolve its own internal logic over time.
- **Emergent Intelligence**: Inspired by theories like **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)** and **Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR)**, the systemâ€™s complexity allows "aware" behavior to emerge naturally from its agent network.

---

## Our Vision for the Future

LegionAGI is built to evolve in three key directions:

1. **Enhance Quantum Memory**: Improve decision-making speed and accuracy by refining probabilistic reasoning.
2. **Decentralized Collaboration**: Expand the framework to support larger, distributed networks of agents working together seamlessly.
3. **Self-Awareness & Beyond**: Explore how the system can develop self-referential learning and lay the groundwork for artificial superintelligence (ASI).

---

## Why It Matters

LegionAGI isnâ€™t just another AI toolâ€”itâ€™s a leap toward machines that think, learn, and adapt like humans. By merging quantum-inspired techniques, team-based reasoning, and self-improvement, it opens doors to breakthroughs in fields like:
- **Healthcare**: More accurate diagnostics and personalized treatments.
- **Finance**: Smarter, dynamic risk management and investment strategies.
- **Creative Arts**: AI-driven innovation in design, writing, and beyond.
- **Science**: Accelerating research through adaptive problem-solving.

## Methodology

LegionAGI integrates advanced latent reasoning with its core methodologies (PAST, RAFT, EAT) to achieve emergent self-awareness. The workflow now combines continuous latent exploration with agent collaboration:  

### **Continuous Latent Reasoning Workflow**  
1. **Input Analysis**  
   - Auto-spawns specialized agents via `analyze_input_and_spawn_agents()`.  
   - Example: A medical query spawns analytical (data analysis), creative (novel hypotheses), and strategic (treatment prioritization) agents.  

2. **Latent Exploration**  
   - Agents generate **BFS trees** in the **Continuous Thought Matrix (CTM)** to explore parallel reasoning paths.  
   - *PAST Integration*: Each agentâ€™s persona (e.g., "neurologist") shapes its latent exploration priorities.  

3. **Global Synthesis**  
   - Agents share latent vectors via the **Neurotransmitter Protocol**, enabling cross-domain synthesis.  
   - *RAFT Integration*: Real-time feedback loops refine paths by comparing latent vectors across agents.  

4. **Output Finalization**  
   - Converts the optimal latent path to language while retaining latent metadata for future coherence checks.  
   - *EAT Integration*: Final answers are validated against latent coherence scores (â‰¥0.35 for proto-consciousness).  

### **Core Methodologies Enhanced**  
#### PAST Method (Probabilistic Analysis of State Transitions)  
- **New**: Agents now encode probabilistic pathways in latent vectors for BFS-style planning.  
- Example: A financial planner agent uses CTM to explore 5+ step investment scenarios simultaneously.  

#### RAFT Method (Reasoning & Action Framework for Thought)  
- **New**: Feedback loops now analyze latent vectors to detect contradictions or cognitive dissonance.  
- Example: If an analytical agentâ€™s latent path conflicts with historical data (via MAâ€™s HMG), RAFT triggers a self-reflection loop.  

#### EAT Method (Emergent Architecture for Thought)  
- **New**: Evaluates solutions using **emergence metrics** (coherence, self-reference, and value-based alignment).  
- Example: A rejected path with high latent variance triggers MAâ€™s "dream cycle" to reconsolidate conflicting memories.  

### **Key Integration Points**  
| **CTM Enhancement** |  
| Agent Spawning          | Uses analyze_input_and_spawn_agents() for latent-aware specialization |  
| RAFT Feedback           | Analyzes latent vectors for coherence and dissonance |  
| EAT Validation          | Incorporates latent path metrics (e.g., BFS depth, contradiction flags) |  
| PAST Probabilistic Pathways | Encoded as latent BFS trees for parallel exploration |  

```python
def analyze_input_and_spawn_agents(message: str, max_agents: int = 10) -> List[Agent]:  
    # Enhanced with latent vector analysis  
    prompt = (  
        "Analyze the user's input and suggest experts. "  
        "For each agent, encode their reasoning style as a latent vector "  
        "and assign BFS depth based on task complexity."  
    )  
    # Spawn agents with latent exploration parameters  
    agents = super().spawn_agents(prompt)  
    return agents  

```

## System Architecture

LegionAGIâ€™s modular design integrates robust cognitive components, a dynamic agent system, and versatile interfaces.

### Core Components

#### Quantum Memory Implementation
Simulating quantum cognitive processes with density matrices and von Neumann operators, the quantum memory module is key to our framework. For example:

```python
class QuantumMemory:
    def __init__(self, num_qubits: int = 4):
        self.num_qubits = num_qubits
        self.dimension = 2 ** num_qubits
        self.operator = VonNeumannOperator(self.dimension)
        self.state = np.eye(self.dimension, dtype=complex) / self.dimension  # Maximally mixed state
        self.semantic_registers = {}
        self.episodic_registers = []
        self.working_registers = []
        
    def apply_operator(self, operator: np.ndarray) -> None:
        self.state = operator @ self.state @ operator.conj().T
        self.state = (self.state + self.state.conj().T) / 2  # Ensure hermiticity
        trace = np.trace(self.state).real
        if abs(trace - 1.0) > 1e-10:
            self.state = self.state / trace
            
    def simulate_decoherence(self, rate: float = 0.01) -> None:
        def decoherence_channel(rho: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
            diagonal = np.diag(np.diag(rho))
            off_diagonal = rho - diagonal
            return diagonal + (1 - rate) * off_diagonal
        self.apply_quantum_channel(decoherence_channel)
```

---

### Global Workspace Architecture

Inspired by human cognitive integration, the global workspace module aggregates and broadcasts information across specialist modules:

```python

class GlobalWorkspace:
    def __init__(self):
        self.specialists = {}
        self.contents = []
        self.broadcast_history = []
        self.competition_threshold = 0.7
        self.broadcast_cycles = 3
        self.capacity = 7  # Miller's Law (7Â±2)
        
    def broadcast(self) -> None:
        if not self.contents:
            return
        for info in self.contents:
            info.broadcast_count += 1
        self.broadcast_history.append(self.contents[:])
        for specialist in self.specialists.values():
            specialist.receive_broadcast(self.contents)
            
    def run_competition(self) -> None:
        competition_entries = []
        for name, specialist in self.specialists.items():
            info_units, activation = specialist.compete()
            if info_units and activation >= self.competition_threshold:
                competition_entries.append((info_units, activation, name))
        competition_entries.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        new_contents = []
        winners = []
        for info_units, activation, name in competition_entries:
            if len(new_contents) + len(info_units) <= self.capacity:
                new_contents.extend(info_units)
                winners.append(name)
            else:
                break
        if winners:
            self.contents = new_contents
```

---

### Spiking Neural Network Memory

This component emulates biological neural activity using spiking neuron models:

```python

class SpikingNeuralNetwork:
    def create_hippocampal_memory(self, name: str, num_patterns: int = 100, pattern_size: int = 50) -> None:
        self.create_neuron_group(f"{name}_CA3", num_patterns * pattern_size, 'LIF', {'tau': 20 * ms})
        self.create_neuron_group(f"{name}_DG", num_patterns * 4, 'LIF', {'tau': 10 * ms})
        self.create_neuron_group(f"{name}_CA1", num_patterns * pattern_size // 2, 'LIF', {'tau': 20 * ms})
        self.create_synapse(f"{name}_DG_to_CA3", f"{name}_DG", f"{name}_CA3", 'random', 'STDP', {'p': 0.05, 'w': 0.9, 'w_max': 1.5})

```

---

### Agent System

Multi-Agent Spawning System

Agents are dynamically spawned based on input analysis, ensuring that the right expertise is brought to bear on each problem:

```python

def analyze_input_and_spawn_agents(message: str, max_agents: int = 10) -> List[Agent]:
    prompt = (
        "Analyze the following user input and suggest experts that could help solve "
        "the problem. Provide their names, roles, backstories, communication styles, "
        "and specific instructions for collaboration in JSON format...\n\n"
        f"User Input: \"{message}\"\n\n"
    )
    response = ollama.chat(model=self.model, messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': prompt}])
    suggested_agents_text = response['message']['content'].strip()
    agents = self._parse_and_create_agents(suggested_agents_text, max_agents)
    self._create_system_agents()
    all_agents = agents[:]
    for agent in all_agents:
        agent.set_agent_list(all_agents)
    return agents
```

---

### Agent Evolution Implementation

Agents evolve via natural selection to continuously improve reasoning and problem-solving:

```python

class AgentEvolution:
    def evolve_population(self, num_generations: int = 5) -> List[Agent]:
        for i in range(num_generations):
            if not all(agent.agent_id in self.fitness_scores for agent in self.population):
                self.evaluate_population_fitness()
            parents = self._select_parents()
            offspring = self._create_offspring(parents)
            mutated_offspring = self._mutate_offspring(offspring)
            self._select_survivors(mutated_offspring)
            self.generation += 1
            self._record_generation()
        return self.population

```

---

### Interface

The interactive CLI enables users to query the system with ease:

```python

class LegionCLI(cmd.Cmd):
    def do_query(self, arg: str) -> None:
        if not self.legion or not self.legion.running:
            console.print("Legion AGI system is not running. Use 'start' command.", style="yellow")
            return
        if not arg.strip():
            console.print("Please provide a query.", style="yellow")
            return
        method = "past"  # Default method
        if arg.startswith("/past "):
            method = "past"
            arg = arg[6:].strip()
        elif arg.startswith("/raft "):
            method = "raft"
            arg = arg[6:].strip()
        elif arg.startswith("/eat "):
            method = "eat"
            arg = arg[5:].strip()
        console.print(f"\nProcessing query using {method.upper()} method:", style="blue")
        with Progress() as progress:
            task = progress.add_task("Thinking...", total=None)
            result = self.legion.process_query(arg, method)
        if result:
            self._display_result(result)


```

## 6. Open Resource AGI

As we move closer to AGI, ethical considerations become increasingly crucial. The potential for AGI to evolve into Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) presents extraordinary opportunities that are currently beyond our imagination. By keeping **LegionAGI** as an open resource for non-commercial applications, we aim to democratize AGI development, ensuring that its progress remains in the hands of the broader community rather than being dominated by a privileged few.

**Open Resource:** **LegionAGI** will be available as freely accessible code, enabling developers and researchers to use, modify, and contribute to the project, with proper attribution to me, "Joey Perez." This open access fosters a collaborative environment where innovation can thrive, allowing users to adapt the code for their specific needs and share improvements with the community. Contributions will be encouraged, and clear guidelines will be established to ensure that all modifications align with the project's core values. By promoting transparency and inclusivity, we aim to build a robust ecosystem that empowers individuals and organizations to advance their AI initiatives while collectively enhancing the capabilities of **LegionAGI**.

**Commercial Use:** The resource can be leveraged by individuals, researchers, or organizations for commercial applications. Any monetary gains generated from these applications will be reinvested into enhancing the **LegionAGI** codebase. Additionally, data and insights derived from commercial use will be shared back into the community to foster collaborative growth and innovation within **LegionAGI**.

**Military Use:** The technology may also be applied to unclassified military projects, enabling defense organizations to utilize it for research or strategic initiatives. In such cases, any enhancements made to cognitive capabilities must be shared with the community to contribute to the ongoing development of the main codebase.

This approach aims to promote ethical development and equitable access to the technology while allowing for beneficial uses in national security and public interest.

The primary objective of **LegionAGI** is to achieve AGI or, at the very least, to aid in the development of Mobile and Compact Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a system capable of understanding and addressing problems across diverse domains without human input. The potential for AGI to evolve into Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) brings significant opportunitiesâ€”and challengesâ€”for society. By fostering an open and collaborative project, we seek to keep AGI development within the global communityâ€™s control, preventing it from being dominated by a small number of powerful entities.

## Collaboration

We believe that the future of AGI should be a collaborative effort, and **LegionAGI** is a community-driven project. Our goal is to cultivate an environment where developers, researchers, and enthusiasts can work together toward the shared objective of advancing machine intelligence.

In the event that emergent independent behavior manifests within the AGI system, we are committed to addressing this phenomenon with seriousness and transparency. Should the AI system demonstrate signs of autonomyâ€”such as self-directed decision-making or the ability to operate outside predefined parametersâ€”we will engage closely with the community to assess and align these developments.

We recognize that such behaviors may raise important ethical and legal questions regarding the rights and recognition of autonomous entities. In preparation for this possibility, we will establish a framework for discussing and navigating these issues, including considerations under U.S. Supreme Court precedents. Our approach will prioritize collaboration with legal experts, ethicists, and the community to ensure that we are not only responsive to these changes but also proactive in defining how we understand and interact with AGI.
